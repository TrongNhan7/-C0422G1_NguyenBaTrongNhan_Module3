            <p>Erik ten Hag (Dutch: [̍ˈeːrɪk tən ɦɑx] (listen), born 2 February 1970) is a Dutch professional football
                coach and former player, who is currently the manager of Premier League club Manchester United.
                As a player, Ten Hag played as a centre-back in the Dutch league for 13 years, making appearances for
                Twente (three spells), De Graafschap, RKC Waalwijk and Utrecht. He won the 1990–91 Eerste Divisie with
                De Graafschap and the 2000–01 KNVB Cup with Twente.
                In 2012, Ten Hag was appointed as manager of Go Ahead Eagles in the Eerste Divisie. He went on to coach
                Bayern Munich II from June 2013 until 2015;[4] during his time as manager Ten Hag led his team to the
                Regionalliga Bayern.[5] Ten Hag then became the sporting
                director and head coach of Utrecht in the summer of 2015.[6] In December 2017, he was appointed as the
                manager of Ajax, and in 2019 he led his Ajax team to the semi-finals of the 2018–19 UEFA Champions
                League for the first time since 1997.[7] He won his first managerial
                trophy with Ajax with the 2018–19 KNVB Cup,[8] followed by the Eredivisie title which brought a double
                for the club.[9] In 2021, Ten Hag guided Ajax to their record extending 20th KNVB Cup,[10] and in
                January 2022 he became the fastest manager in league history to reach 100
                wins with Ajax, achieving the feat in 128 matches,[11] before transferring to Manchester United in May
                that year.</p>
